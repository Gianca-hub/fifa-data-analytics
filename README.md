Main Description

This is a repository to store all of the information and progress I make with my analysis project for my Advanced Data Analytics course.

Data Set and why I chose it

Link to dataset
My data sets contains the Name, system released on, year of release, publisher, genre, and the sales split across NA, EU, and JP.
I'm interested in this topic because I love games and I've been gaming since I was a kid. My goal with this data set is to map sales trends within series (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Super Mario, etc.) as well as overall yearly sales trends in order to see how consumer tastes might shift from year to year.
For example, did the sales of one game within a series increase because it was more well-received or because the general sales of the year increased.
