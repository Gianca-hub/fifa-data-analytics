# fifa-data-analytics
## Main Description
I make this repository to store the information and all progress  for my Advanced Data Analytics project.

## Data Set and why I chose it
[Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset)   
I chose that database because it is interesting to explore the fifa 23 database. The data set contains the Name, Age, Nationality, Club, Overall, Potential, Value, Position,Height/Weight, Preferred Foot, Skills Moves, Weak Foot, Work Rate.   
This data is very interesting for me and the people who likes to play fifa because in this project i am going to analyze player performance, attributes, and values across different positions, clubs, and nationalities. 
For example: the objective for this project are to analyze distributions of player ratings and values, to compare performance metrics across positions and clubs, to investigate correlations between player attributes and market values, and to visualize trends using different tools.
